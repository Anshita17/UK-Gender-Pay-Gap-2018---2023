The dataset comprises gender pay gap data across UK companies with 250 or more employees, spanning six years from 2018 to 2023.


The UK Gender Pay Gap data from 2018 to 2023, dataset captures gender pay disparities across UK organizations with over 250 employees. This pay gap data helps measure gender equality within organizations by focusing on mean and median hourly pay differences, bonus distributions  of male and female employees. Used Excel to analyze and visualize this data, draw meaningful insights, and present  work professionally.



Objective: The primary goal is to analyze and understand gender pay gap trends across various sectors and company sizes in the UK from 2018 to 2023.
The insights aim to uncover include:

* Trends in the gender pay gap over the years,
* Company size-specific insights to identify industries with larger or smaller pay gaps,
* Detailed metrics on how male and female representation differs in terms of pay quartiles and bonuses.

Key Questions
1. Yearly and Multi-Year Trend Analysis:
    * Which years show the most significant changes in the mean gender pay gaps?
    * Can we observe any consistent improvement or decline in gender pay equity across the dataset’s time range (2018-2023)?
2. Geographical Analysis 
    * Are there geographical patterns in the pay gap? For instance, do companies in certain areas of the UK report higher or lower pay gaps?
3. Employer Characteristics:
    * How does company size  impact the gender pay gap? Are smaller or larger companies showing more progress?
4. Quartile Representation and Progression:
    * Is there a trend in the progression of female representation in higher pay quartiles over time?
Scope: We analyzed multiple datasets, including six years of gender pay gap data and supplementary company information, using Excel for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

Analysis and Insights
Yearly and Multi-Year Trends:
* Objective: Identify significant changes in mean and median gender pay gaps across years.
* Key Insight: There was a noticeable improvement in gender pay equity from 2020 onwards, with the mean gap narrowing by 2.32 % from 2018 to 2023.

Geographical Patterns:
* Objective: Identify regional patterns using Country data.
* Key Insight: Companies in Northern Ireland  had lower pay gaps, compared to others.
* Trends show pay gap in England , Wales is decreasing over years.
* Trends show Pay Gap in Scotland has sudden increase from 2022- 2023
	
Employer Characteristics:
* Objective: Analyze pay gaps based on company size (EmployerSize).
* Key Insight: Smaller companies (<250 employees) showed lower pay gaps than companies with more than 250 employees
* 
Quartile Representation:
* Objective: Examine the trend in female representation in higher pay quartiles.
* Key Insight: Female representation in the top quartile increased by 6.41% over the six-year period, indicating slow but steady progress.

Visualization:
* Developed a comprehensive dynamic dashboard in Excel featuring  interactive charts to visualize:
    * Year-over-year trends in gender pay gap.
    * Geographical distribution of pay gaps across urban and rural areas.
    * Representation of females in higher pay quartiles over time.




Recommendations:
1. Promote Female Leadership in Higher Pay Quartiles:
    * Companies should focus on increasing female representation in top-paying roles. Over the six years, the data shows only a 6.41% increase in female representation in the top quartiles, indicating the need for a more aggressive approach.
    * Implement leadership development programs targeted at women, offering mentoring, training, and career progression opportunities.
Bonus and Incentive Equity:
* The data reveals disparities in bonus payments between men and women. Companies need to develop more equitable bonus distribution systems, ensuring that criteria for awarding bonuses are based on performance rather than subjective factors.
* Regular audits of bonus systems should be conducted to identify any potential bias.
Targeted Support for Larger Companies:
* Larger companies (over 250 employees) consistently show a greater pay gap compared to smaller companies. These organizations should be given tailored guidelines and support from governmental or industry bodies to develop specific initiatives aimed at gender pay equity
Conclusion:
This analysis of the UK Gender Pay Gap data from 2018 to 2023 highlights critical trends in pay disparity between men and women. While there has been some progress in reducing the mean pay gap (by 2.32% over the six years), significant work remains, especially in improving female representation in top pay quartiles and addressing bonus pay discrepancies.


Call to Action: Organizations must adopt data-driven, transparent approaches to close the gender pay gap. By focusing on leadership development for women, promoting pay transparency, and ensuring equitable bonus systems, companies can make strides toward achieving greater gender equity in the workforce.
Overall, the insights and recommendations provided offer actionable steps to drive positive change in reducing the gender pay gap across industries and regions in the UK.
